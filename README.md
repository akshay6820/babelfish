# babelfish

_Typing is hard. Calling someone is harder._

Using speech to text in combination with text translation and text to speech, we built a tool not unlike Google's `new` babel platform. Call someone, input the language and they will hear what you say in another language ðŸ˜®. #amazing #mindblown.

## Setup:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
vim requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
